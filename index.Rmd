## Hi there! 

My name is Marisa. Iâ€™m a data scientist, currently based in Canmore, Alberta. 

My work is focused on the design and evaluation of evidence-based programs, technologies, and systems to improve societal well-being. I have proven experience tackling complex analyses and communicating actionable insights from these analyses through presentations, written reports, and data visualizations. 

Outside of work, I love hiking, playing with my puppy Atlas, baking, and exploring various creative outlets.

If you're interested in collaborating, please reach out!  :)
